# FM-GAN

This repository is the implementation for paper 
[Adversarial Text Generation via
Feature-Moverâ€™s Distance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06297.pdf)

## Requirement:
Python 2.7, Tensorflow 1.8.0

## Run 
* Run: `python autoencoder.py` for MLE pre-train
* Run: `python text_GAN.py` for adversarial training
* Options: options can be made by changing `option` class. 

## Note:
`model.py`: sinkhorn divergence edition

`model2.py`: IPOT edition

## Dataset:
MSCOCO dataset and WMT news dataset can be downloaded from link **HERE**:

## Evaluation:
Use `convert_new.py` to convert the indexed files to sentences.
Then use `selfbleu.py` and `testbleu.py` to evaluate the results.

Note that it is just a rough edition, you have to change the file names manually in the code, we will update this ASAP.

## TODO:
1. Clean the code, make it easy to understand.
2. Don't need to manually change the file names in the code.
3. etc.
