# FM-GAN

This repository is the implementation for paper 
[Adversarial Text Generation via
Feature-Moverâ€™s Distance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06297.pdf)

## Requirement:
Python 2.7, Tensorflow 1.8.0

## Run 
* Run: `python autoencoder.py` for MLE pre-train
* Run: `python text_GAN.py` for adversarial training
* Options: options can be made by changing `option` class. 

## Note:
`model.py`: sinkhorn divergence edition

`model2.py`: IPOT edition
